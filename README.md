# NASSboard
This is a shiny app that provides a dashboard for interactively mapping NASS census data.  USDA NASS data is freely available
to the public, but accessing the API through this package requires an API key.  Keys are free and easy to request [here](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api).
If you enjoy the app, but would like to see some new features or bug fixes, I'd love to hear from you!

## Installation and Running the App

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("mchizk1/NASSboard")
    NASSboard::NASSboard()
